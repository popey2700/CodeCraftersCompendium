## Why does this project exist?

As I continue to learn and improve as a developer I pick up lessons from my own experiences as well as from working with talented devs. These learnings are littered throughout note apps and pieces of paper which coincidentally get lost. This repo exists to be a sort of Compendium and evolving history book of my learnings and philosophies throughout my software career.
