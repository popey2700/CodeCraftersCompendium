## What is a coding Ideology?

In short a coding ideology refers to a set of guiding principles, philosophies, or beliefs that influence the way a developer or a development team approaches and practices coding. These ideologies provide a framework for making decisions about how code should be written, organized, and maintained. They can shape the coding style, development processes, and overall approach to software development. A coding ideology often reflects the best practices and values that are considered essential for producing high-quality, maintainable, and efficient code.
