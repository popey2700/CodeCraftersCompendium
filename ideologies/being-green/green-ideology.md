## What is green software?

Green software stands at the crossroads of climate science, software design, electricity markets, hardware, and data center planning.

In essence, green software is all about reducing carbon emissions in software development to the minimum possible. Achieving this involves focusing on three core areas: energy efficiency, carbon-conscious practices, and hardware optimization. This guide aims to elucidate these principles, elucidate their application in workflows, demonstrate measurement techniques, and provide insights into the international standards and overseeing bodies that shape this evolving domain.

The best resource I've found for learning about green software/tech is [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/) which is a non-profit dedicated to green software and tech. Credit to [Oliver Marsden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-marsden/) for introducing this non profit to me. I have stolen a lot of their wording and fully give them credit for that.

## Who is this relevant to?

Anyone involved in the process of building, deploying, or managing software. By studying these principles, a green software practitioner can make decisions that have a meaningful impact on the carbon pollution of their applications.

## How to be a green software practitioner

I would highly recommend taking the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/) training course however I will summarise in this Compendium.

The following traits are things that a green software practitioner needs to be aware of:

- [Carbon Efficiency](./carbon-efficiency.md): Emit the least amount of carbon possible.
- [Energy Efficiency](./energy-efficiency.md): Use the least amount of energy possible.
- [Carbon Awareness](./carbon-awareness.md): Do more when the electricity is cleaner and do less when the electricity is dirtier.
- [Hardware Efficiency](./hardware-efficiency.md): Use the least amount of embodied carbon possible.
- [Measurement](./measurement.md): What you can't measure, you can't improve.
- [Climate Commitments](./climate-commitments.md): Understand the exact mechanism of carbon reduction.
